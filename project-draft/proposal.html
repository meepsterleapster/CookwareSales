      Problem Domain
    </h2>
    <p>Access to kitchen tools can be a siginificant barrier for individuals who enjoy cooking but cannot afford or justify purchasing kitchen equiments. For many people, especially students or those living in urban areas, getting access to the right kitchen tools can feel like a challenge whether its the cost or the fact that you might only need something once, for example, like a pasta maker for experimenting dinner. It often doesn't make sense to buy expensive equipment for that occasion. Unfortunately, this means people miss our on exploring new recipes or techniques due to that barrier or buying things they'll only use once, adding to unnecessary waste.</p>
    <p>While some peer-to-peer platforms (e.g., Etsy or Ebay) allow buying or in some case renting various items from other users for cheap, they often lack a system tailored specifically for renting kitchen tools.</p>
    <p>Some of this is based on:

    <h2>
      App Description
    </h2>
    <p>The web app is designed to make it easy and afforable for people to rent and lend kitchen tools to their local communities. Instead of having to buy an equipment for yourself and only having to use it once, the platform allows the users to borrow a tool from someone nearby. The app is intended for home cooks who want to try our new tools without committing too hard, people who own kitchen equipment they're not using and want to earn some extra cash by lending it, and for students and groups on a budget who loves to cook but can't afford high-end tools.</p>

      <h3>Some actions a user can perform:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Set a price of kitchen item they have</li>
        <li>Submit a Request form to rent an item</li>
        <li>Search for specfic item in listing by nearby location</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <p>A significant portion of the information our application utilizes comes from client interaction. Our application is designed for users to post their equipment online for others to buy. This is why we will collect some personal information on users as a precautionary measure. The other information we collect is at the time of a kitchen tool posting we collect a price, location, picture, quality, small description, etc. Aside from this, the main API we think we will rely on heavily is a Google Maps API. When people post, we want their location to be easily viewable along with directions to get to the POI, etc. </p>
    <!-- I'm not sure if the app is going to use any data or APIs so I'm avoiding the question for now -->
    <p>The app isn't just about saving money, but also an opportunity for people to explore their passion for cooking without breaking the bank or cluttering the kitchen with stuff they rarely use. BThis app also helps encourage reducing waste and builds a sense of commmmunity among food lovers.</p>
